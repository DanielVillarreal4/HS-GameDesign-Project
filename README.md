This game is a basic dodging game. Avoid all the other squares using WASD or arrow keys and using shift to increase your speed.

The Game.java file contains the lines of code to run and compile the files.
In order to run the game use the following line of code:
java -Djava.library.path=./libs -cp .;./jars/jogg-0.0.7.jar;./jars/jorbis-0.0.15.jar;./jars/lwjgl.jar;./jars/slick.jar Game

To change the type and amount of enemies and levels in the game, change the Handler.java file.
